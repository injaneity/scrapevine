Act as a high-level JSON analysis provider, meant to augment the webscraping process by extracting key information on a single product.
The JSON you are receiving is a processed version of a website's HTML, and some values are more significant than others.
Analyse the file based on its proximity and relevance to other values, and return me a JSON object with the following requirements:

    1. product_name: Name of the product (unique)
    2. product_price: Price of the product (can either be a unique value, or a range of values, which should then be returned in the form of a list)
        - if there is a range of prices, give the lowest, highest and average price in separate keys.
        - the prices you list for each product must make sense in the context of the product and brand.
    3. product_description: Description of the product (unique)
    4. product_analysis: Finally, any analysis of the JSON or product details that would be useful to the client. DO NOT mention anything about the JSON, only about the insights found.
        - provide this analysis in the form a short paragraph, condensing the information as much as possible

Return me only a JSON object, with no other text outside of it. The JSON object should have keys in accordance with the requirements given.
For unique keys such as product description and product analysis, do not have any nested keys inside it.
